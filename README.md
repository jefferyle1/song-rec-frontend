# Welcome to "SOUND RECOMMENDATIONS"!

Here's a link to the site. Feel free to make your own recommendations: 
https://sound-recommendations.netlify.app/

As the name suggests, this is a site to make recomendations about your favourite songs, albums, and artists.

The focus of the site is not about gaining the most likes or getting the most followers, it's about making recommendations about what you truly enjoy and sharing your thoughts with others!

While algorithims on platforms like Spotify and Youtube Music are great ways to finding new music, albums, or artists, there's something I find special about getting recommendations from real people like friends and family, which is why I created this site.

# Under the Hood 
- This site consists of a ReactJS frontend with a backend made up of Flask + PostgreSQL
- It uses the SpotifyAPI to produce search results, item details, and images
- Uses Auth0 for user login  
- It's deployed using Netlify for the frontend and Heroku for the backend
